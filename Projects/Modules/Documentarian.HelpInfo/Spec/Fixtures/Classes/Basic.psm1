# This class is for testing HelpInfo and decorating comments.
# It only has decorating comments, no parseable blocks.
#
# The First property is documented with a line comment. The
# Second and Third properties are documented with block
# comments. The Fourth property has no comment.
#
# The default constructor has no comments. The second constructor
# has an external line comment. The third constructor has an
# internal line comment.
#
# The DoNothing methods are documented with external comments.
# The Repeat and ToUpper methods are documented with internal
# comments.
