        Synopsis: >-
          Synopsis for this overload.
        Description: |-
          The external comment is ignored because this overload
          has a comment block immediately inside the body. The
          synopsis is used for the method overall because it's the
          first declared overload and the class comment block doesn't
          have this method in it.

        Synopsis: >-
          Synopsis for this overload.
        Description: |-
          Because this block is immediately before the overload, it's used
          for the overload's help. This overload has no examples.

        IsHidden: false
        Attributes: []

        Synopsis: >-
          Synopsis for this overload.
        Description: |-
          Because this block is immediately inside the overload, it's
          used for the overload's help. This overload documents the
          `$first` parameter in the block, but uses a decorating
          comment for the `$third` parameter.
        Examples: []
        IsHidden: false
        Attributes: []
        Parameters:

            Type: System.String
            Description: |-
              The documentation for the `$first` parameter. This overrides
              the decorating comment above the parameter.
          - Name: third
            Type: System.Int32
            Description: "Block comment decorating the `$third` parameter. It spans\nmultiple lines.\n\nIt even has a second paragraph.\n        "
